Function Test-IsValidEmailAddress {
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Tests validity if specified string is an email address.
.DESCRIPTION
    Casts the passed value as "System.Net.Mail.MailAddress" data type.
    If successful it parses string into the properties: DisplayName, User, Host, Address
    White space normally delimits the DisplayName from the address so an extra check
    is performed to see if EmailAddress specified matches the resolved Address property
.EXAMPLE
    Test-IsValidEmailAddress -EmailAddress "user@gmail.com"

    Would return:
    True
.EXAMPLE
    Test-IsValidEmailAddress "bademail"

    Would return:
    False
.EXAMPLE
    Test-IsValidEmailAddress "test user@gmail.com" -verbose

    Would return:
    VERBOSE: You entered email address: [test user@gmail.com]
    VERBOSE: Address resolved to: [user@gmail.com]
    VERBOSE: [user@gmail.com] does not match [test user@gmail.com]
    VERBOSE: The address is NOT valid.
    False
.EXAMPLE
    Test-IsValidEmailAddress -EmailAddress "user@gmail.com" -verbose

    Would return:
    VERBOSE: You entered email address: [user@gmail.com]
    VERBOSE: Address resolved to: [user@gmail.com]
    VERBOSE: Address valid, no guarantee that address [user@gmail.com] exists.
